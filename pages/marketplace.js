            as government initiatives govern oil-based lubricants to bolster
            market growth with a CAGR of almost 4.7% 2022 â€“ 2029 (2021 = $2.92
            billion/2029 forecast = $4.26 billion). While this segment makes up
            less than 1.5% of the global finished lubricants market, it is

            investment in R&D activities are expected to drive the market during
            this period/ The factors are expected to ensure that the
            bio-lubricants market growth in the coming years. North America and
            Europe account for three-quarters (3/4) of the EAL demand due to
            strict environmental policies. Industrial applications, led by
            hydraulic fluids (considered an Accidental or Partial loss
            application susceptible to accidental or intentional spillage), make
            up the majority of consumption. Synthetic esters are the base stock
            of choice for more than two-thirds of demand.`}
