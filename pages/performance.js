            {`A variety of teams in recreational and profession racing are
            rigorously testing the endurance as well as the performance
            qualities of b2 biOil’s within the most extreme engine conditions.
            These innovative formulations have been previously tested and proven
            in the race cars and on the tracks of the most extreme racing
            conditions, featuring NASCAR and the former Grand Am and American
            LeMans Series. Dyno testing by Tri-Star and Rousch Yates racing
            showed and confirmed an increase in horsepower when using a
            bio-based synthetic formulation.While maintaining excellent
            stability in rigorous lubricating environments, b2 biOil base oils
            (> 25% bio-content) biodegrade when released into the environment at
            a rate of 82.9% (OECD 301B). Bio-sourced (mandated bio-content
            requirements) does not always equal biodegradability. As for us, all
            b2 formulations are made with domestically sourced bio-content and
            are “readily biodegradable.” This bio-derived synthetic ester base
            stock modified with an enhanced/advanced additive package delivers
            plenty of advantages, including maximum lubrication protection and
            improved engine performance along with increased fuel economy.`}

            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Natural Detergency </span>– As
              polar compounds, b2 biOil base oil has the unique ability to
              dissolve sludge and varnish, helping equipment stay clean and
              operate efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Thermal Stability </span> –
              Excellent resistance to decomposition at high temperatures.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">4-Ball Wear </span>– Base oils
              have an increased affinity for metal surfaces, allowing them to
              prevent wear by forming protective barriers between moving parts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Hydrolytic Stability </span> –
              Superior ability to resist chemical composition (hydrolysis) in
              the presence of water and ideal for applications whereby risk of
              water contamination is high
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold"> Evaporative Loss (NOACK) </span>–
              Reduced oil loss due to evaporation, viscosity is better
              maintained, fuel economy improves and increased phosphorous
              retention.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold"> Flash Point </span> – Ideal for
              applications where operating temperatures are high and
              flammability is a concern.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-bold"> Oxidative Stability </span> –
              Increased oil longevity for extended drain intervals, excellent
              response to antioxidant additives, less equipment downtime and
              reduced maintenance costs.

            <li>
              <span className="font-bold"> Viscosity Index </span>– Enhanced
              film thickness at elevated temperatures, improved equipment life
              and reliability; and, reduced viscous drag on moving parts

            Proven By The Military
          </h3>

          <p className="max-w-full tracking-wide">
            {`   The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), provider of logistical,
            acquisition and technical support for the Army, Navy, Air Force,
            Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Space Force, United States Postal
            Service, NASA and other federal agencies and allies, in partnership
            with the Air Force Research Laboratory, conducted testing and
            validation for over four (4) years of bio-based synthetic motor oils
            in government vehicles at four Air Force bases, the Department of
            Homeland Security installations, FLETC and others.`}

          <h3 className="text-main italic mt-5 text-xl">Successful Results</h3>
          <p className="tracking-wide">
            {`Air Force personnel at Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base in North
            Carolina separated four vehicles from the motor pool and replaced
            the conventional oil (Schaeffer Re-Refined Motor Oil) with b2 biOil.
            The conventional oil was sent to a lab for analysis for the purpose
            of establishing a baseline for later comparison with the bio-based
            product. Over several weeks, project participants repeated this
            procedure on a total of 40 vehicles at the DHS Federal Law
            Enforcement Training Center in Georgia, Luke AFB in Arizona,
            Fairchild AFB in Washington and Malmstrom AFB in Montana. The
            manufacturer of b2 had made strides over the past decade as industry
            test results showed that the use of “green” lubricants contributed
            to improved gas mileage, longer oil-change intervals and the
            reduction of greenhouse gases. In addition, the b2 biOil lubricants
            can simply replace conventional oil without modification to the
            engine. The Department of Defense (DoD) uses about 1.1 million
            gallons of 5W-20 and 5W-30 engine oil annually in 190,000 vehicles.
            The entire federal government, including the military services,
            civilian agencies and the US Postal Service maintains a total of
            633,000+ vehicles. Testing and evaluation showed that b2 is
            comparable to and better than conventional oil which could lead to a
            complete conversion to bio-based synthetic motor oils in the federal
            government’s fleet of non-tactical vehicles. Pressure to convert
            comes in the form of DoD sustainable procurement directions
            (including the USDA Bio Preferred Mandated Federal Procurement
            Program), Federal Acquisition Regulations and laws such as the Farm
            Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which stresses the need
            for the government to procure and use bio-based products. The
            successful outcome is great news for farmers as it will expand the
            market for domestically produced agricultural products. Other
            benefits include a reduction in life-cycle carbon footprint and
            dependency on foreign petroleum.`}
